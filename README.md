# code-assessment
Timed code quiz that pseudo-randomly chooses from an array of question objects and populates the page with the question prompt and a varying amount of choices. Incorrect answers will decrement the timer by 5 seconds. Scores for each user will be saved alongside their initals in local storage. This information will be displayed on the page by clicking on High Scores.
